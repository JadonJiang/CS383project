5.	How to build a release of the software?
	You can update your software based on the previous generation. You can directly put the updated code on the official website (GitHub). We suggest that you keep the code of each version, but rewrite the user documentation and developer documentation for each version of the code. This can help your users understand the update status of this version and decide whether to update to the modified version.
