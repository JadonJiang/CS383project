This program design is to use the student achievement management system written in object-oriented C + +, define a class student to store the basic information and basic operations of students, and define an object of class "studentmanager" and "studentmanager", that is, the student achievement management system. The grade management system provides batch import (from file import, manual entry), display, query, modify, add, sort, delete and other operations of student information.
The program uses the console as the output interface and the keyboard as the input. Various operations can be completed by following the prompt information of the console.
